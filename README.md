# Real-Time Maze Solver with Iterative Deepening Depth First Search
This Java program showcases a real-time maze-solving algorithm utilizing Iterative Deepening Depth First Search (IDDFS). The maze is randomly generated, and the solving process is dynamically visualized in a GUI window. The application is developed using the Java Swing framework.

## Features
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the maze-solving process unfold in real-time with a graphical interface.
- **Iterative Deepening Depth First Search**: Utilizes IDDFS for efficient maze exploration and solution finding.
- **Java Swing Interface**: Interactive GUI built with Java Swing to display the maze and the solving steps.

## How It Works
- Maze Generation: Generates a random maze with guaranteed path to the randomly placed goal.
- Algorithm Execution: Applies the Iterative Deepening Depth First Search algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the goal.
- Real-Time Display: Updates the GUI to show the algorithmâ€™s progress, including explored paths and the final solution.
